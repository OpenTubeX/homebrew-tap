  caveats <<~EOS
    OpenTubeX Nightly installs untested development builds and may be unstable.
    It uses the same app and settings as the stable OpenTubeX cask.

    OpenTubeX is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized by Apple.
    If macOS blocks the first launch, allow OpenTubeX in System Settings > Privacy & Security.
